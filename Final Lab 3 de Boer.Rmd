Installing required packages and libraries
First we will install packages rtweet and github.
```r
install.packages("rtweet")
install.packages("githubinstall")
githubinstall::gh_install_packages("rtweet",  ref = "5ef897e",dependencies=TRUE, ask= FALSE)
1
library("rtweet")
```

### Connecting R to Twitter
Next, we create a developer profile through Twitter, start a new app, and get a key, so we can link R to Twitter. 
```r
my_tokens <- create_token (app = "UChicago_Lab",
                           consumer_key = "ldvwVWOFLJjVj8LCEaZUHlL0J",
                           consumer_secret = "vtFkOlmNBrDpcixuSQjvZPRMbF7mnQ9Qno4ChQk3M6pStW8jw5")
```
Next we'll save the tokens in a file so we can retrieve it later.
```r
save(my_tokens, file = "./my_tokens_env")
load("./my_tokens_env")
```

### Building a Query
We're going to build a query to pull 18000 tweets (that being the limit) that contain the phrase "Tara Reade". This query excludes retweets.
```r
Tara_Reade_Tweets <- search_tweets("Tara Reade", n = 18000, include_rts = FALSE)
```
Here, we geocode the Tweets, thanks to a Google API key that we've also obtained recently through a generous free trial:
```r
Reade_Twitter <- search_tweets("Tara Reade", n = 18,000, geocode = lookup_coords("usa"), type = "recent", retryonratelimit = TRUE)
```

### Mapping Our Results
We're going to locate the latitude and longitude and map them onto a map of the U.S. with state lines.
```{r, results='markup'}
Reade_Twitter <- lat_lng(Reade_Twitter)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
maps::map("state", lwd = .25)
with(Reade_Twitter, points(lng, lat, pch = 20, cex = .75, col = rgb(0, .3, .7, .75)))
```
Finally, we'll put in our title and source.
```r
title("Tweets mentioning 'Tara Reade' in the United States", line = 1)
title("Source: Twitter", line = -9)
```
